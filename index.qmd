**Does the strength of the relationship between intelligence and education change over time?**

Using the 10-item vocabulary test called "Wordsum" as a proxy for intelligence, we produced a series of plots to visualize the change in the relationship between intelligence and education level from 1974 to 2020. \n \n

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gssr)
library(ggpubr)

# Load the GSS data
data(gss_all)

# Prepare the data
gss_data <- gss_all %>%
  select(year, wordsum, educ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(wordsum) & !is.na(educ)) %>%
  mutate(decade = case_when(
    year >= 1970 & year < 1980 ~ "1970s",
    year >= 1980 & year < 1990 ~ "1980s",
    year >= 1990 & year < 2000 ~ "1990s",
    year >= 2000 & year < 2010 ~ "2000s",
    year >= 2010 & year < 2020 ~ "2010s",
    year >= 2020 ~ "2020s"
  ))

# Create a scatter plot with a smooth line and correlation coefficient by decade
ggplot(gss_data, aes(x = educ, y = wordsum)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue") +  # Make points more transparent
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 1.5) +  # Increase line width and change color
  facet_wrap(~ decade) +
  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..), method = "pearson", label.x = 15, label.y = 11, size = 4, color = "black") +  # Add correlation coefficient
  labs(title = "Relationship between Intelligence (Wordsum) and Education Level by Decade",
       subtitle = "The strength of the relationship seems to be weakening with time",
       x = "Education Level (Years)",
       y = "Wordsum Score",
       caption = "Source: General Social Survey") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The strength of the relationship between intelligence (Wordsum proxy) and education seems to be decreasing with time.
